## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS (flexbox)
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I mainly learned some new tricks in CSS about using multiple images and layering them. Also about different ways to incorporate images to the page so that they behave as expected (mainly overflow wise). About HTML I improved my knowledge in SEO and optimization. I didn't have to use a lot of JS, so there was no new knowledge obtained in that field. 


```css
.new-CSS-trick-I-learned {
  background: url(images/illustration-woman-online-desktop.svg) -5.6vw 3vw / 32vw no-repeat, url(images/bg-pattern-desktop.svg) -30vw -14vw / 110vh no-repeat;
}
```

### Continued development

I would make the page more responsive on mobile screens, but to achieve that I would change the design a bit so that you wouldn't have to modify the images as absolutely positioned objects.
